            The Akaeze Reading program has four components: Reading,
            Discussions, Vocabulary and Essay writing. The purpose of this
            program is to help students cultivate a reading habit and develop
            critical thinking and communication skills. The maiden edition of
            this program took place from August 11 to September 8, 2018. The
            book of choice was Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe and the
            discussions centered around gender roles, domestic violence and
            toxic masculinity, using references from the book. We also created
            opportunities for our students to build their vocabulary and writing
            skills through vocabulary quizzes and essay writing. To our
            surprise, our pupils were so engaged in the discussions that we had
            to plead with them to take their lunch breaks even though we served
            very sumptuous meals. To round off the program, we gave two awards -
            one to the most active student and the other to the student with the
            best essay. In addition, every student not only received a copy of
            Things Fall Apart but also received school supplies to prepare for
            the next school session.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            What we achieved with this program was phenomenal. Our students left
            with a deep understanding of why domestic violence should not be
            condoned. Our girls left with greater confidence that they were
            equal to their male counterparts and our boys became conscious of
            how to prevent toxic masculinity. In light of these achievements,
            the Akaeze summer reading program will be one of the main annual
            programs hosted at our educational resource center. We are excited
            to continue to use this medium to educate the next generation and
            build people with superb character.

            At the 2019 edition, the literature of choice was “Dear Ijeawele, or
            a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions” by Chimamanda Adichie.
            We extensively discussed the concepts of feminism and sexual assault
            and had interesting conversations about marital rape and the
            stigmatization of sexual assault victims in Nigeria. At the end of
            the program, our students gained a better understanding on why it’s
            important to advocate for women’s rights, what constitutes consent,
            and how to deal with sexual assault cases. As usual, students
            received school supplies and we gave three awards - quiz whiz,
            aspiring author and star student. This time around, we asked our
            awardees what gift they would like, and they suggested we take them
            out for lunch, games and to watch a movie. We gave them what they
            asked for and they had a swell time.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Our goal is to make it an annual event that will help students
            develop their reading, writing and speaking skills and at the same
            time, educate them on local and global issues. Unfortunately, this
            program did not take place in 2020 due to Covid 19 restrictions.
