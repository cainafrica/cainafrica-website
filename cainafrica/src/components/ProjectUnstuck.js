                        The Unstuck Project is dedicated to empowering motivated individuals in Nigeria by providing them with the essential tools and support to embark on a career in tech. We believe that technology is a powerful force for liberation and empowerment. Our sponsorship program offers recipients a laptop, a monthly stipend, internet connectivity, and mentorship for a year. By the end of the 12-month period, participants will have gained the skills and independence needed to pursue further education or new job opportunities.

                        <b>Our Target</b>
                        <br /><br />

                        Our target group includes secondary school graduates awaiting university admission and university graduates awaiting their youth service. By providing them with the necessary resources, we aim to help them break free from the cycle of poverty and unlock their full potential. We believe in creating opportunities that empower individuals to shape their futures and contribute meaningfully to society.
                        <br /><br />

                        <b>Sustaining the Initiative</b>
                        <br /><br />
                        We rely on the generosity of well-meaning Nigerians at home and abroad to sustain this initiative. The Unstuck Project provides a platform for those in the diaspora to give back to their community through financial contributions and mentorship.

                        <br /><br />
                        In partnership with iShareHope, we will manage the donation platform and provide mentorship, while CAIN Africa will handle student recruitment and program navigation. This collaboration ensures that our participants receive comprehensive support, helping them to navigate the challenges of their journey and achieve their goals.
